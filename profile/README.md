# 🧩 ArcTRC

> Think of it as testosterone replacement for Claude Code — a framework that injects structure and enterprise discipline.

ArcTRC helps Claude Code think like an architect.

It gives Claude the context and structure to build real software, not just snippets.  
Instead of random code generation, ArcTRC sets the tone — how things are organized, how modules connect, how systems scale.  
The goal is simple: help Claude build software that looks like it came from an experienced engineer.

ArcTRC is built around strong architectural principles.  
Domain-driven design, clean boundaries, modular patterns — the stuff that keeps projects alive when they grow.  
It doesn’t slow Claude down; it guides it to make smarter, more maintainable decisions.

Every project starts with a framework that actually understands architecture.  
That’s what ArcTRC brings to the table.

### 🚀 Vision

To bridge AI’s creativity with human engineering discipline.  
So Claude stops guessing and starts building with purpose.

---

### 🧠 Built For

- Developers who care about clean, scalable architecture  
- Teams who want Claude to produce production-grade systems  
- Builders who believe structure should come before speed  

---

### ⚙️ Status

ArcTRC is still in active development.  
The core CLI and prompt layers are being shaped, tested, and tuned.  
Even early builds already make Claude’s output cleaner and more structured.
